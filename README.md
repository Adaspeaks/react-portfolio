# 20 React Portfolio

## Description

My task was to create a react portfolio that used an navagational bar to leverage the swapping between pages.
This is all done in pretty much vanilla react with no backend running behind the scenes.

## Installation

All necessary dependencies can be installed by using

```
npm i
```

into the your terminal of choice.

## Usage
There really isn't a "use case scenario' for this one, it's just a prototype for a future react driven portfolio.

Navagating the page though is simple. Towards the top right you are able to see a "hamburger menu" that will allow you to change the content of the page.

About me will give you a small history on my and my feelings when I wrote it at the moment. 

Portfolio will give you  clickable links to some of my favorite projects that we did throughout the course. I wanted to include links to their deployed versions but alot of them did not have them. Simply as some were run by the command line or were simply used through outside programs like insomnia.

Contact me will present you with a form that will prompt you for Name email and message but none of these are connected to a backend at the moment to collect this data... so it's a lemon for the time being.
